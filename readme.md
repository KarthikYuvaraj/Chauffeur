# Chauffeur

Welcome to Chauffeur, deliverying changes to your Umbraco environment in style.

## Who is Chauffeur?

Chauffeur is a CLI for Umbraco, it will sit with your Umbraco websites `bin` folder and give you an interface to which you can execute commands, known as **Deliverables**, against your installed Umbraco instance.

Chauffeur is developed for Umbraco 7.x as it is designed around the new Umbraco API.

# Getting Started

To get started install Chauffeur and open up a command window and launch `Chauffeur.Runner.exe`, which is the entry point for Chauffeur. From the prompt you can get started running deliverables.

# Build Status

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/py65p0vnrjb4m7sx)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/aaronpowell/chauffeur)

# Running Demo

The easiest way to run the demo application is to execute the `run-demo.ps1` script from the root. This will:

- Compile
- Install the demo website using Chauffeur
- Start IIS Express for the demo website

## Included Deliverables

### Help

_Aliases: h_

    umbraco> help

List all the Deliverables which are installed.

    umbraco> help <deliverable>

Executes the help system for the specified Deliverable. If the deliverable doesn't implement `IProvideDirections` you won't get any additional documentation and I suggest you bug the author of the Deliverable.

### Quit

_Aliases: q_

    umbraco> quit

Exists Chauffeur

### Install

_Aliases: none_

    umbraco> install

Installs an empty Umbraco database. This is like running the Umbraco installer from the web UI.

While the installer runs it will create the `User` with the the `0` ID, the default user account. This account will have the default username and password as Umbraco provides (which is `admin` and `default`) but you probably won't be able to log in with it as the password is meant to be hashed but the SQL doesn't hash it. You should combine this with the `user` Deliverable to setup the correct user password.

If you're using SqlCE as the database then the Deliverable will prompt tp create the file as well as run the SQL scripts, if you don't want to be prompted pass `y` to the Deliverable when run. If you're using a different database provider make sure there is an empty database to connect to.

**Note: The Deliverable expects the Umbraco connection string to be set in the web.config.**

### User

_Aliases: u_

    umbraco> user <delivery> <arguments>

A series of sub-deliveries which can be undertaken against Umbraco users

#### Change-Password

    umbraco> user change-password <id> <old password> <new password>
    umbraco> user change-password 0 default password

Changes the password of a user, you generally want to combine this with the `install` Deliverable so you can setup a user that can log in.

### Package

_Aliases: p pkg_

    umbraco> package <package name>

A Deliverable that will look for a file with that name and a `.xml` extension in the Chauffeur directory with which it can import items from an Umbraco export and import the contents into the database. The XML can be either from the Umbraco packager (yes, you have to extract the XML file from the ZIP), by using the Export option in the back office or by using the files generated by [`usync`](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/usync).

The following types can be imported:

* Document (Content) Types
* Data Types
* Templates
* Macros

**Note: There is an expectation that with Templates and Macros the files are on disk (eg: in your VCS), this just created the database entries so they appear in the back office.**

### Delivery

_Aliases: d_

    umbraco> delivery

Tells Chauffeur to locate all `.delivery` files and run them in order. If a delivery is successfully delivered it will be tracked in the database as such and skipped next time you run the Deliverable.

#### Delivery Files

This is just a plain text file which contains a series of Deliverables to execute.

Let's assume we had one called **001-Setup.delivery**

The contents might be:

    install y
    user change-password 0 default my-secret-password
    package DataTypes
    package Templates
    package Macros
    package DocumentTypes

### Content-Type

_Aliases: ct_

    umbraco> content-type <delivery> <arguments>

A series of sub-deliveries which can be undertaken against Umbraco ContentType's.

    umbraco> content-type get-all

Lists all ContentType's in a quick summary.

    umbraco> content-type get <id or alias>

Gets a specific ContentType and lists its properties.

    umbraco> content-type export <id or alias>

Exports a specific ContentType which is then output to Chauffeur's directory.

    umbraco> content-type import <exported file name>

Imports a ContentType from the specified file, you don't need to provide the `.xml` extension it is assumed.

### Change Alias

_Aliases: ca_

    umbraco> change-alias <type> <old> <new>

A deliverable which will change the alias of a particular Umbraco "type", such as a Document Type. This is useful as there's no way from the Umbraco packager to do an alias change.

# FAQ

* Why do I see all this extra text when I run `content-type` commands?

> This is a fun bug in 7.0.4, they included some `Console.WriteLine` statements in the source code which Chauffeur ends up receiving. This seems to have been resolved in 7.1.0.

* Can I make my own Deliverables?

> Sure you can, you need to implement the `Deliverable` class and drop your assembly in the `bin` folder and it'll be loaded up.

* What doesn't work?

> Keep in mind that this is running outside of the web context so there's no HttpContext. This means that some Umbraco API's simply won't work, things like the publishing. Also be  aware of the pointy edges of the Umbraco API, there's a lot of `internal` classes and members that Umbraco will expect (have a look at the PropertyGroupId setup) so things might not be setup that you'd expect. Remember we're using the Umbraco APIs but we're bypassing the Umbraco "boot" process. At the moment you have to manage your own dependency chain, and if there are statics these can bleed across Deliverables so be aware.

* Where do I put the files for the `delivery` and `package` Deliverable?

> Chauffeur expects these files to be on disk in the `App_Data\Chauffeur` folder, where `App_Data` is relative to the root of the website (where your `umbraco.config` lives).
